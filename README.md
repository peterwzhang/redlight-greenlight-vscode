  - `warn`: Show warning message (default)
  - `close`: Immediately close VSCodetyping game extension for VSCode that helps improve focus and typing discipline. Only type during GREEN light phases - typing during RED light will trigger configurable consequences!

## Features

üéÆ **Interactive Game Panel**: A dedicated panel in the Explorer view with real-time game controls and status

üö¶ **Red Light Green Light Phases**: 
- **üü¢ GREEN LIGHT**: Type freely and make code changes
- **üî¥ RED LIGHT**: Stop typing immediately or face consequences!

‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Timing**:
- Set custom durations for red and green light phases
- Enable random timing mode with min/max ranges
- Configure grace period for reaction time after red light starts
- Fine-tune the challenge to your preference

üéµ **Sound Effects**:
- High-quality MP3 audio files using sound-play library
- Cross-platform audio support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Separate sounds for red light, green light, violations, and game start/stop
- Adjustable volume and individual sound toggles

üéØ **Smart Features**:
- Real-time timer display (can be hidden in settings)
- Session statistics tracking
- Visual feedback and status updates
- Command palette integration

## How to Use

1. **Find the Game Panel**: Look for "Red Light Green Light" in the Explorer sidebar
2. **Start Playing**: Click "Start Game" or use Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) ‚Üí "Start Red Light Green Light Game"
3. **Follow the Lights**: 
   - üü¢ **GREEN LIGHT**: Type away, make changes, code freely
   - üî¥ **RED LIGHT**: Stop all typing immediately! (You have a small grace period to finish current keystrokes)
4. **Configure Settings**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Red Light Green Light to customize

## Grace Period Feature

The grace period feature provides a small buffer time (default: 0.5 seconds) after the red light starts where typing is still allowed. This helps account for human reaction time and prevents frustrating violations when you're already in the middle of typing.

**How it works:**
- When red light starts, you have a configurable grace period to finish typing
- After the grace period expires, any new typing will trigger violations
- Grace period can be adjusted from 0 to 5 seconds in 0.1-second increments
- Set to 0 for immediate enforcement (hardcore mode!)
- Recommended: 0.3-0.7 seconds for most users

* `redLightGreenLight.randomTiming`: Configure random timing ranges
  * `maxTime`: Maximum random time (2-120 seconds, default: 15)
  * `minTime`: Minimum random time (1-60 seconds, default: 3)

### Game Behavior

## Tips for Success

- Start with longer intervals (10+ seconds) and gradually decrease
- Use the warning action first before trying the close action
- Enable sounds for better audio cues - add your own MP3 files for custom audio
- Random timing mode adds unpredictability and challenge
- Adjust grace period to match your reaction time (0.5s is good for most users)
- Hide the timer for a more immersive experience or to reduce anxiety
- Practice restraint - the goal is to develop better coding flow awareness

## Known Issues

- Audio requires the sound-play library and system audio support
- Audio files must be MP3 format and placed in assets/sounds/ directory
- Large audio files may cause loading delays - keep sounds short (0.5-2 seconds)
- Volume control is handled by system audio settings
